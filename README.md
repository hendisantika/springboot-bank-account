## Bank Account REST API
## What is this project for?

The goal of this mini project is to write a simple micro web service to mimic a “Bank Account”. Through this web service, one can query about the balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. Just like any Bank, there are restrictions on how many transactions/amounts it can handle. The details are described below.
- Write a simple “Bank Account” web service using REST API design principles.
- Program should have 3 REST API endpoints: Balance, Deposit, and Withdrawal
- No requirement for authentication assume the web service is for one account only and is open to the world
- No requirement for the backend store you can store it in a file or database (your decision)
- Balance endpoint this will return the outstanding balance
- Deposit endpoint credits the account with the specified amount
  - Max deposit for the day = $150K
  -  Max deposit per transaction = $40K
  -  Max deposit frequency = 4 transactions/day
- Withdrawal endpoint deducts the account with the specified amount
  - Max withdrawal for the day = $50K
  - Max withdrawal per transaction = $20K
  - Max withdrawal frequency = 3 transactions/day
  - Cannot withdraw when balance is less than withdrawal amount
- The service should handle all the error cases and return the appropriate error HTTP status code and error message (Eg. If an attempt is to withdraw greater than $20k in a single transaction, the error message should say “Exceeded Maximum Withdrawal Per Transaction”).
